# VgamePad Setup & Configuration Guide

## GTA5 Controller Automation System

### Project Overview

This guide focuses on setting up and configuring vgamepad for GTA5 automation. VgamePad creates a virtual Xbox controller that appears as legitimate hardware to games, making it undetectable by anti-cheat systems. This is the foundation for all GTA5 automation features.

### Basic Implementation Example

```python

class RunescapeController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gamepad = vg.VX360Gamepad()
        self.last_input = time.time()

    def send_input(self, button, duration=0.1):
        # Add human-like delay
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.05, 0.15))

        # Press button
        self.gamepad.press_button(button)
        self.gamepad.update()

        # Hold for duration
        time.sleep(duration)

        # Release button
        self.gamepad.release_button(button)
        self.gamepad.update()

        # Add post-input delay
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.3))

    def chop_tree(self):
        self.send_input(vg.XUSB_BUTTON.XUSB_GAMEPAD_A)

        self.gamepad.left_joystick(x_value=0, y_value=32767)
        self.gamepad.update()
        time.sleep(duration)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Low Risk

- **Controller Detection**: Appears as legitimate Xbox controller
- **Input Patterns**: Can be randomized to appear human-like
- **Software Detection**: No memory injection or process manipulation

### Medium Risk

- **Game Updates**: Could change controller support
- **Input Timing**: Too perfect timing could be suspicious
- **Pattern Recognition**: Repeated sequences might be detected

### High Risk

- **Browser Automation**: Still needed for webOSRS (detectable)
- **Screenshot Analysis**: Required for game state detection
- **Network Traffic**: API calls for game state analysis

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Randomize all inputs** with human-like variations
- **Implement break scheduling** to avoid continuous operation
- **Monitor for detection** warnings or unusual behavior
- **Use hybrid approach** to minimize browser automation
