# YOLO Annotation Format Template
# Each line represents one object in the image
# Format: class_id center_x center_y width height
# All coordinates are normalized (0.0 to 1.0)

# Class IDs:
# 0 = tree
# 1 = oak_tree
# 2 = willow_tree
# 3 = rock
# 4 = iron_rock
# 5 = coal_rock

# Example annotations:
# 0 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.2    # A tree in the center-left
# 1 0.8 0.6 0.15 0.25  # An oak tree in the bottom-right
# 3 0.2 0.7 0.08 0.12  # A rock in the bottom-left

# How to annotate:
# 1. Use LabelImg (pip install labelimg)
# 2. Open LabelImg and set format to YOLO
# 3. Draw bounding boxes around objects
# 4. Save annotations as .txt files with same name as images
